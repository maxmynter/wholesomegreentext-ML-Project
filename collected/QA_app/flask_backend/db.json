I've been wanting to leam about tabletop/roleplaying games for a while, starting with DC Adventures/Mutants and Masterminds, and she happened to be super into tabletop\ngames/dungeon mastering. She's drawn tons of original heroes and villains. Just a super cool, creative person. She keeps saying she wants to run a superhero game for me but I don't know any other players, and she doesn't want to do it online.\nCO Anonymous 09/22/15(Tue}20:18:55 No. 76034772 > >=76034799 >=Te0AND90 >>76N45730\nFile: 1390701406277 jpg (17 KB, 350x277)\n>> 76034681\n>Nah, we're just really good, fast friends that have a ton in common.\nYeah, Sure.\n.\ni?\nC1 Anonymous 09/22/15(Tue)20:20:17 No.76034799 > >\u00bb76034968 >>76034962 >>76D43009 >> 76045063,\n276034772\n\u2018We've only known each other for like 2 months, I don\u2019t think she feels that way about me.\n276034799\nNobody plans a whole rpg for \u201cjust a friend\u201d, dude.\nC Anonymous 09/22/15(Tue}20:27:59 No. 76034962 \u00bb >-76036071\n>> 76034888\n>> 16034799\nC1 Anonymous 09/22/15(Tue}20:28:17 No.76034969 \u00bb\n>> 76034888\nShe's just a really nice, fun, creative person.

She got prepared for her online course and then I watched some Rick and Morty while she did her stuff. Afterwards it as Spm and she joined me on the couch. I didn't really know what to do,\n50 we just kept watching. She would inch a litle closer now and then, get up to do something then come back and sit down until we were pretty much touching. It was pretty late by this point, any chance of her catching a bus home was gone but\nneither of us said anything. We just kept watching cartoons,\n\u2018At some point she put her hand on my knee and said, \u201cHey.\u201d I looked over at her, and she just leaned in and kissed me. Just a quick peck, then she sat back abruptly like she was expecting me to react negatively, gauging me for any response. I was\njust smiling like an idiot, and then we both tried to speak at the same time to break the awkwardness. We stopped talking to let the other speak, and then didn't, and just sat there for maybe 15 seconds of silence.\nShe asked \"Is that okay?\u201d And I said \u201cIts alright.\u201d Which I realize now is what I had kept repeating to her when we first met and she was breaking down. So she asked if we could just keep kissing. I said permission granted and we both laughed. Then\nwe made out for maybe a half hour before just laying on the couch together. We fell asleep like that. This morning she had to go early because she had plans with her sister who is in town, but we're going to get together for lunch.\nSo, things are good.\nC1 Anonymous 09/23/15(Wed)1 1:29:45 No. 76046642. \u00bb >>76040605 \u00bb>76046961\n>> 76046091\nIs your name Aidan?\nC1 Anonymous 09/23/15(Wed)1 1:42:27 No. 76046961 \u00bb \u00bb>7e047182 \u00bb>76049062\n>> 76045642\nNo, sorry.

A few weeks after we had moved in, aur neighbors moved in. I remember the moving truck being there and wondering what was going on. So I went outside to\ninvestigate. Just a bunch of adults moving funiture aut of the truck. Im not interested anymore. Well, im outside, might as well go play with my Tonka trucks in the ditt pit out back.\nThen I saw a git in the backyard. She looked at me and ran around the far side of her house. For some reason I cannot explain to this day, I ran along side my house to my front yard. There she was. Upon seeing me, she ran aut of view to the\nback yard, Again, i did the same. This stupid shit went on a few more times before i said the 4 year old version of \u201cfuck it\" and just walked over.\nAfter some awkward introductions we became friends.

I liked climbing trees, so did she, I liked to play Tonkas in the ditt pit (a 66 spot in the yard my dad made for me), she really was into creating channels that represented rivers and making\ntoothpick or popsicle stick bridges in there, so she usually ended playing the role of foreman And i drove the tankas around digging out her rivers.\nNaturally, we spent more time tagether than we did with friends of the same sex. I clearly remember at BBQs or just idle talk between our parents, the running gag was that we were going to marry after highschool. I think the fact that we were friends at such a young\nage and really enjoyed playing together, eased the issue of leaving us alone tagether.\nAnonymous 12/09/1{Mon)18:56:28 UTC-T No.520498113 Repies: 2=520495261\n22520497905\n\u2018As we got older, the leash that tied us to the house was removed. around 9, We discovered that over the hill behind our houses existed a forest. \u201cPlay in the woods\u201d was the common phrase.

I remember that day clearly. The snow fall had\ncovered the clearing making the area look pristine. We walked to the tree in the center and I gave her the frst gif I could afford on my own.\nAs dumb, or as comy as it may seem, it was the first Calvin and hobbes book. She was a huge CBH fan. i was never good at thinking up thoughtful one-iiners, so i just put Happy 13th birthday femanon! I was given a hug as a thank you and she sat\nup against the tree we began reading tagether. She was halfway through before the sun had set and it was impossible to continue. But we did not leave. We continued to talk for about 20 minutes before falling silent.

And at an unknown point in their lives, that switch fips to ON. Such was the case with my mother. It started with yelling and arguing. Then closet alcoholism, soon, men i had never met before started\n\u2018coming home with her when my dad was at work. this went on until the summer of 1996, That's when the term Divorce became a regular part of my parent's vocabulary. It was very ugly. But in the end, my mather won custody of me, and got the house, and pretty much\neverything else. We started our sophmore year tagether, but after a month, I was told we were moving. My mom would not tell me where, or give me an address thinking i would give this info to my father {which he would get anyway through the courts but at 16, i dont\nknow how that shit works). I wanted to give femanon that info so we could remain in contact {remember, 1996. no FB. Intemiet was still foreign to us).

It was very early and I had to sneak out of the house, because at this point, my mom prohibited me fram seeing the neighbors. She thought they were working with my dad to mine me for information. I knocked on her\n\u2018window and she pointed me to the back door. Her parents greeted me there which i thought had me busted. The past year had fucked up my understanding of them and constantly having to avoid my mother bled into me viewing all adults as evil. She came out dressed\nand ready to spend aur last day tagether, and her parents handed her a bag of food,\n\u201cYou two spend as much time together as you need.\"\nWe left and headed to the place.\nmost of the day was spent talking about how much bullshit it was that i was moving. it wasnt until the evening when we reached the bottom of the bag of food and found an unopened condom. Instead of trying to discover how it got there, nature took aver.\n\u2018Once we were clothed again, the condom disposed of, several hours passed in total silence. Just holding one another. The full moon sat directly above us illuminating the entire area. It was then I checked my watch.\n0255\nThe moving van would arrive in \u00a7 hours.

Besides, I now lived 200 miles away. at 17, it was viewed as impossible. Also the insane amount of prescription drugs she had me on for bullshit reasons helped with pushing it from my mind. I joined the Navy at 18, spent 6 years there {AS) went to\nschool to get a BS in network admin {linux) and began my career.

She never married. She dated but she said none of them ever felt right like we did. What I did find amusing was she went to school for and\nbecame a Civil engineer.
